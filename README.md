# AssignRegionalClassification
This is an R Markdown document to assign UN's regional classification to DHS countries (or any group of countries). In multi-country studies, regional classification is often an important variable. Different classification methods are used per various purposes, but a widely used standard classification is from UN Statistics Division's ["standard country or area codes for statistical use (__M49 standard__)"](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/). The M49 standard classification is used as reference. 

There are three sections in the markdown file: 1. getting DHS country list, 2. getting UNSD's list, and 3. merging the two. 

Output is published in RPubs:(http://rpubs.com/YJ_Choi/485032).
